He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse, [**Hospital3 17394**] dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a [**2101-10-15**] study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2101-10-12**].\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on [**2101-10-21**]\\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof [**2101-10-20**]; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn [**2101-10-21**], the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy [**2101-10-23**], he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of [**2101-10-25**], the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on [**2101-10-26**] when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on [**2101-10-27**]; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non [**2101-10-26**], the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn [**2101-10-21**], his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n[**2101-10-28**], and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on [**2101-10-29**].\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on [**2101-10-28**].\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on [**2101-10-24**].  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.
